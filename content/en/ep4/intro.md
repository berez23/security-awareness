# Episode 4 {.otherpages}
## Ransomware {.home}

In this episode we discover another "enemy of security": <b>the obsolescence of systems and software</b>.

It often happens, both in private companies and in public offices, to deal with <b>long-standing computers, with obsolete software and with poor internet connections</b>, with little bandwidth (browsing speed). In this episode we discover how this situation exposes us to threats, sometimes even trivial, on the security of the information we manage. Trivial on the surface, in fact, but <b>extremely dangerous</b>!
